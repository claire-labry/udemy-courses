## data structures & algorithms notes

### big o & scalability 
 - when we talk about big 0 and scalability of code we simply mean grow bigger & bigger with our input. how much does the algorithm slow down? the less it slows down the better.

### o(n) & o(1)
 - O(n) is in linear time and O(1) is in constant time. O(n)'s number of elements will effect the time/# of operations. O(1) number of elements does not impact the number of operations because it only picks the first item of the array when the function(operation) is run.
