# javascript the advanced concepts

- notes: 
    - the computer doesn't understand javascript without a translator. in this case the translator is an ECMAScript engine, i.e. V8 engine. At the end of the day, the computer reads in zeros and ones. 
    - the father of the first javascript engine is Brendan Eich.
    - any one can build a javascript engine, however it would be chaos if that was the case, so thats why EMCAScript was implemented to set up standards on what can be an engine.
